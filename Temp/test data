            [faq] => 
Can it be used on live site ?



PLEASE DON'T! Amongst the defined constants are your database credentials, so you really do not want to do this.
This plugin is only meant to be used for development purposes.


What are constants ?



From PHP.net:



  
A constant is an identifier (name) for a simple value. As the name suggests, that value cannot change during the execution of the script. A constant is case-sensitive by default. By convention, constant identifiers are always uppercase.

  
  
Like super globals, the scope of a constant is global. You can access constants anywhere in your script without regard to scope. For more information on scope, read the manual section on variable scope.



I don't see my constants in the WP Constants list. What gives ?



Congratulations! Sounds like you're practicing lean programming (or something is going wrong... ;-) ).


The constants you see are the ones available in the current request. If you define constants in a conditionally included file - for instance you only include the file when on a certain page -, these constants will not be available if the conditions have not been met.


The number of constants is different on each page/most pages. How come ?



See the previous question.


What are class constants ?
